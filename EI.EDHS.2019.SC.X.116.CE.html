<p>Prior to the 1600s, scientists could only view the world through their naked eye. However, between 1590 and 1610, the introduction of two valuable inventions suddenly allowed scientists to see whole new worlds. One, the telescope, gave them the ability to see the planets and stars like never before. What other scientific tool do you think was invented at this time? What world did it show scientists?

<p>In 1590, a glasses maker in the Netherlands named Zacharais Janssen invented the first compound microscope. About 70 years later, Dutch tradesman Anton van Leeuwenhoek improved on the design and used it to make the first observation into the world of microorganisms. These small single-celled creatures, which van Leeuwenhoek called <em>animalcules</em>, are too small to see with the naked eye. Later, English scientist Robert Hooke used a similar device to view many microorganisms and developed the cell theory of life.</p>

<p><span style="color: rgb(153, 51, 0);"><strong>Microscopes</strong></span></p>
<p>The simplest type of microscope is a hand-held lens, like a magnifying glass. This type of lens can enlarge an image so that it can be seen in greater detail. It is very handy for out in the field, but has limited ability to magnify. In the lab, scientists wanted something better. They put two lenses together and made a compound microscope.</p>
<p>A compound microscope is an optical device that is used in many scientific fields. Optical devices use the properties of light to accomplish their task. Optical devices often use mirrors lenses or both. In this case, compound microscopes use two lenses &#x02013; the eyepiece and the objective &#x02013; that magnify the image. The lenses used in a microscope are convex or converging lenses. The total magnification of a compound microscope is the product of the magnification of the two lenses.</p>

<p class="caption" style="text-align:center;">Compound microscopes have similar structures. The light sources shine through the sample on the stage and through the objective and eyepiece lenses.</p>
</div>
<p>A compound microscope usually contains its own light source. The light source is a small lightbulb that provides the light that passes through the lens. It shines through the sample and through the objective lens. The objective is closer to the sample. Some microscopes use mirrors to reflect room&apos;s light to the slides you view. In some cases the mirrors are used to avoid heating the sample which can happen if the lamp is too close.</p>
<p>The first compound microscopes had one objective lens, but many compound microscopes, today, have two or three, with varying levels of magnification. Objective lenses have a magnification of 10x, 20x, 40x, or even 100x or 200x. A magnification of 10x means that the image you see is ten times the size of the object.</p>
<p>The lens a viewer looks into is called the eyepiece. It is found at the top of the microscope. The eyepiece enlarges the already enlarged image produced by the objective lens. The eyepiece usually has a magnification of 10x. Some compound microscopes have a two eyepieces, one for each eye. The maximum magnification a compound microscope allows is usually around 2000x. This allows the viewer to see human and animal cells, bacteria, protozoa, and algae. However, a compound microscope is not strong enough to view molecules, atoms, or viruses.</p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(153, 51, 0);"><strong>Telescopes</strong></span></p>
<p>About the same time biologists were putting the optics to work to look at the microscopic world, astronomers were putting those same principles to use to view the cosmos. Instead of viewing tiny objects that are very close, astronomers could use optics to look at large objects that are very far way. Italian astronomer and engineer Galileo did not invent the first telescope, but in 1609, he created an improved version that allowed him to view moons orbiting Jupiter and the rings of Saturn, and to make detailed observations of the surface of the Moon.</p>
<p><strong>Refracting Telescope</strong></p>
<p>The telescope that Galileo used was called a refracting telescope because it used two lenses. The objective lens is a convex lens which helps to collect the light. The light then travels down the body of the telescope, where it is focused on a concave lens in the eyepiece, where observers can see the magnified image.</p>
<p>Because light is being redirected by the convex lens to a small space and then magnified by the concave lens, the image is not always clear. Therefore, with a refracting telescope, the size of the lens limits its magnifying power. To increase the magnifying power to see beyond the planets and moons or the solar system, the lenses need to be very large, and the tube must be extremely long. However, to view objects within the solar system, a small refracting telescope works well due to its simple construction; it is easy to focus and usually less expensive for an amateur astronomer.</p>

<p class="caption" style="text-align:center;">Refracting telescopes are long tubes with the lenses at either end of the tube. The eyepiece and the objective are parallel to one another.</p>
</div>
<p>A series issue that occurs with refracting telescopes is chromatic aberration. Different wavelengths of light (colors) are brought into focus at different points due to the curved nature of the lens. It tends to affect the image more at the edges than in the center; however, it can affect the entire image.</p>
<p>Refracting telescopes are very similar to compound microscopes. Compare and contrast the two devices in the following text box.</p>

<p>Both devices use light to magnify an image. A microscope magnifies objects that are tiny but close. A telescope magnifies objects that are small because they are far away. Both devices use two lenses to focus and magnify the image. One key difference between the two is the lens in the eyepiece. A microscope has a convex lens in the eyepiece, while a telescope has a concave lens there.</p>
</div></div>
<p><strong>Reflecting Telescope</strong></p>
<p>Throughout the 1600s, scientists built bigger lenses and longer tubes for refracting telescopes, but the results were less than successful. In 1688, however, another famous physicist, Isaac Newton, built a new type of telescope called a reflecting telescope, which uses both mirrors and lenses.</p>
<p>Reflecting telescopes use a curved mirror instead of lenses to collect and focus light. The light passes through an open tube to the mirror. A large concave mirror at the end of the tube collects and reflects the light to create an image. This light is reflected to a second flat mirror, placed at an angle, where the image forms. Once the image forms in the small mirror, it is reflected to the lens in the eyepiece, which magnifies the image. Because a reflecting telescope doesn&apos;t refract the image, there is less distortion and the color of the image is true to the image&apos;s real color. However, because of the open construction, the mirror is exposed to the air and needs to be cleaned periodically, which means it also needs to be realigned.</p>

<p class="caption" style="text-align:center;">A reflecting telescope has a concave mirror, a flat mirror at an angle, and a convex lens in the eye piece.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Catadioptric Telescope</strong></p>
<p>Catadioptric telescopes use a combination of refraction and reflection. The name comes from combining two terms. The first term is <em>catoptric</em>, which is an optical device that uses curved mirrors. The second term is <em>dioptric</em>, which is an optical device that uses lenses. These telescopes have fewer aberrations than the other types of optical telescopes.</p>
<p>The most popular type of catadioptric system is called a Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope. In these telescopes, light travels down the tube and reflects off a circular mirror, similar to a reflecting telescope. However, instead of reflecting off an angled mirror, the light reflects off a flat correcting plate that directs it to the lens of the eyepiece in the back of the tube. A drawback of this correcting plate is that it can reduce the amount of light that enters the telescope. Since there is less light coming in, it is harder to view more faint objects in the night sky.</p>
<p>These telescopes tend to be more compact than other types. This makes it easier to store, transport, and set up. However, to achieve the compact size, there are more moving parts and the device is more complex. Whenever a device increases in complexity, it also creates more opportunities for something to fail.</p>

<p class="caption" style="text-align:center;">The advantage of a catadioptric telescope is it is much more compact than a reflecting telescope and provides similar magnification.</p>
</div>
<p>What are the benefits and drawbacks of each of the three types of optical telescopes? Write your thoughts in the following text box.</p>

<div style="visibility: hidden;" id="Exercise140">
<p>Refracting telescopes are fairly simple to construct and are therefore less expensive. However, they have limited ability to magnify and suffer from chromatic aberration. Reflecting telescopes provide the magnification needed to see objects beyond the solar system and do not suffer from chromatic aberration. However, they tend to be big, bulky, and more expensive. Catadioptric telescopes perform very similarly to reflecting telescopes and are less bulky. However, they do not allow enough light to observe the more faint objects in the night sky.</p>

<p><span style="color: rgb(153, 51, 0);"><strong>Other Uses of Mirrors and Lenses</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Corrective Lenses</strong></p>
<p>The first use of lenses, which predates microscopes and telescopes, is in the creation of corrective lenses, originally in spectacles, but then adapted in contact lenses. The inventers of microscopes and telescopes were originally makers of spectacles. The eye has a lens at the front, called the cornea, which focuses the light from objects onto the retina.</p>
<p>Over time, the shape of this lens can change, causing light not to focus properly; these changes can cause blurry images. Corrective lenses provide another source of refraction for the eye, so that the light is focused correctly on the retina. The eyes work differently when focusing on objects near at hand or off in the distance. Some people can focus well on things at a distance, but cannot focus on text in front of them. They only need &quot;reading&quot; glasses for those times. Other people need assistance for reading <em>and</em> seeing things far away. Those people require bifocals, which are a combination of two lenses with different focal points.</p>
<p><strong>Cameras</strong></p>
<p>Cameras work in a similar way to your eye in that they focus light coming from an object. In this case, they focus light on film or on a digital sensor, depending on the camera. Cameras use a set of lenses, convex and concave, to focus the light on the recording medium. When a camera focuses, it is actually changing the distance of the lenses between each other and the film or detector.</p>
<p><strong>Lasers</strong></p>
<p>Lasers create light by exciting atoms, which then releases photons. <em>Laser</em> is an acronym for light amplification by stimulating emission of radiation. Excited atoms create photons in all directions and in several wavelengths. Lasers use mirrors to direct the photons in a particular direction. A laser also filters color so that the light is monochromatic and coherent. <em>Coherent light</em> is light with the same frequency, in phase. The waves of light interfere constructively, increasing intensity. The laser uses a lens to focus the light into a tight beam, focusing all of the light (including all of its energy) into a tight beam. The beam of light can generate a lot of heat and hold its coherence for a long distance.</p>
<p><strong>Data Storage</strong></p>
<p>Data storage and retrieval systems often employ lasers. Compact discs were the first technology to use this system, but other more advanced systems use similar principles. Information is stored as a series of pits with different lengths on the surface of the storage medium. Lasers are focused on the storage medium, and light is reflected back differently depending on the size and frequency of the pits. In this way, the laser &quot;reads&quot; the information stored on the disc. The information can be transmitted through the laser light to another device to process the information and convert it to a form that a person can use.</p>
