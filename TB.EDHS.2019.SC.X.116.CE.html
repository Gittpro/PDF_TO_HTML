<h2 id="heading1"><em>Origins of Optics</em></h2>
<p>For centuries, scientists recognized that light could be reflected off of surfaces and refracted through surfaces. When glass was invented, artisans learned how to make mirrors. The science of optics was born. When the printing press was invented, reading became a more common activity. Often, people would find that the words on the page become blurry. In the thirteenth century, a jewelry artisan created lenses that could help make the words clear. They had developed the first glasses. Today, about three quarters of the American population wear corrective lenses &#x02013; glasses or contacts. Some of them only need those glasses to read, while others need glasses all the time.</p>
<h3><em>Adapting Optics: Microscopes</em></h3>
<p>In the early seventeenth century, a glasses maker in the Netherlands discovered that if a person looked through two lenses at the ends of a tube, it would magnify objects. Small objects that w not visible with the naked eye could now be seen. The glasses maker, a man named Anton van Leeuwenhoek, had invented the first microscope. He was not a scientist. Van Leeuwenhoek and later his friend Robert Hooke refined the first microscopes and began to study the microscopic world.</p>
<p>The first microscope was a tube with a convex lens at either end. The lens closer to the specimen being viewed is the objective lens, and the lens that the person looks through is called the eyepiece. Longer microscopes and microscopes with larger lenses have greater magnification. Since the microscope has two lenses, it is called a compound microscope. That is to separate it from simple microscope, such as a magnifying glass.</p>

<p class="caption" style="text-align:center;">Compound microscopes often have more than one objective lens, but usually only one eyepiece.</p>
</div>
<p>Compound microscopes often have two, three, or four objective lenses with varying magnifications. The lower magnifications are often used to find the specimen to study and then a higher magnification is used to provide more detail. The total magnification of the microscope is found by multiplying the magnification of the objective lens and the eyepiece. The eyepiece usually magnifies 10 times and the objectives are typically 10, 40, 100, or 200 times.</p>
<h2 id="heading2"><em>Adapting Optics: Telescopes</em></h2>
<h3><em>Refracting Telescopes</em></h3>
<p>Italian astronomer Galileo was the first scientist to use a telescope to study space, and the device he used was a refracting telescope. This type of telescope is similar to a compound microscope, but the eyepiece is a concave lens and the objective lens is a convex lens. These lenses are important because they can collect much more light than the human eye. Due to the curved shape of the glass, light is bent as it enters and leaves the lens. The light rays then converge at a focal point within the telescope. When the rays reach the second lens, the eyepiece, they are made parallel again, giving the viewer a brighter, clearer image than what is normally seen.</p>
<p>The magnification of a refracting telescope depend on the length of the tube and the diameter of the mirrors. To provide the magnification to see the light from far away stars, the lenses are very large, unwieldy, and expensive. They do have an issue with distortion of colors around the edges, called chromatic aberration. Larger lenses have greater aberration.</p>

<img width="479" height="222" src="TB.EDHS.2019.SC.X.116.CE\img2.png" alt="Image shows a telescope made of a long tube with a wider end where the light enters and is focused by the lens to the eyepiece, where it is refracted again to the eye"/>
<p class="caption" style="text-align:center;">Refracting telescopes are made from a long tube. The longer tube creates greater magnification.</p>
</div>
<h3><em>Reflecting Telescopes</em></h3>
<p>Reflecting telescopes use curved mirrors to collect and focus light from distant objects. Light enters a large opening at one end of the telescope. It is then reflected off a large, curved mirror at the other end of the telescope. The concave nature of this mirror focuses light onto a second mirror, which reflects the magnified image to the lens in the eyepiece.</p>
<p>A benefit of reflecting telescopes is that their mirrors are less expensive and easier to make. The mirrors, and thus the telescopes, can be made much larger without affecting image quality. Reflecting telescopes can be made with openings that are ten times the size of a reflecting telescope. Another reason reflecting telescopes can be made so large is that their mirrors can actually be made up of many smaller, carefully arranged mirrors.</p>
<p>Reflecting telescopes can magnify very distant objects with great resolution. They do not suffer from chromatic aberration. The most famous application of this technology is the Hubble Space telescope, which was launched in 1990. It can view the cosmos without the interference from light at the surface of the Earth. As of 2021, it will be replaced by a new telescope called the James Webb Space Telescope.</p>
<h2 id="heading3"><em>Other Optical Devices</em></h2>
<h3><em>Lasers</em></h3>
<p>Lasers excite atoms to produce photons, which are amplified by mirrors. These mirrors separate out a single wavelength of light and create coherent waves that constructively interfere and create a more intense wave. The light is then focused by a lens into a tight beam of a single color. The tight beam can be intensely hot and can travel in a straight-line for many miles. The tight beam makes lasers very good for measuring devices, because they stay very straight. Lasers are adapted in several technologies, including data storage and retrieval devices such as a CD-ROM. Lasers are also used in data transmission devices such as fiber optic cables.</p>
<p>Lasers can be reflected off of different mirrors and form three-dimensional shapes in the air. This technique is used to create fantastic light shows and amazing holograms. The images have no substance, but they can look three-dimensional.</p>
<p>Because the light can be focused into a tight beam, a laser can be made to be very hot on a very small surface. Lasers can be made to be effective cutting tools. They can cut through with a straight line without leaving jagged edges. They can also cut in very delicate locations, where precision is required. Lasers have been used in surgery to remove damaged tissue while leaving healthy tissue untouched. They are advantageous for this because while they are cutting, they cauterize or seal the wound, so there is no bleeding.</p>
<h3><em>Cameras</em></h3>
<p>Cameras use lenses to focus light in a similar way to microscopes and telescopes. In 1839, Louis Daguerre developed a camera that focused the light on a copper plate. These cameras were expensive and difficult to use. Only professional photographers had access to these cameras. In the late 1800s, George Eastman created a camera that focused the light on a plastic film that could be developed into pictures. This was the simpler and less expensive option. Many people could afford the Eastman camera and would send the film to his company to be developed. The camera became available to individuals. Most cameras today do not use film. They create a digital image and save it as a computer file. These cameras still have lenses, but the lens focuses light onto a detector that translates the light into a digital image.</p>
<h2 id="summary"><em>Summary</em></h2>
<p>Lenses and mirrors have been used for centuries in a number of industries. The first significant adaptation of lenses came with the invention of glasses. Lens makers discovered that if you stacked more than one lens, smaller objects could be magnified. This principle is used in compound microscopes and refracting telescopes. Mirrors replace many of the lenses in reflecting telescopes. Cameras use a similar technology, but instead of the light being sent to an eyepiece, it is sent to a film or a digital detector. Mirrors and lenses can be used to focus light into the tight beam of a laser. Lasers are used for a number of functions, but common uses include data storage and retrieval, and data transmission via fiber optic cables.</p>
