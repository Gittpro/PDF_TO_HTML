<h2 id="heading1"><em>Applications and Limitations of Science</em></h2>
<p>Many problems in society require analysis or information provided by scientists. Political leaders need to have confidence in information being provided by the scientists in order to make good decisions on how to proceed on these issues. Scientific processes have important characteristics that can inspire confidence. Scientists also have general procedures that they must follow to provide confidence in their work.</p>

<p><em>The shrinking of the polar ice caps is a symptom of global climate change. Political leaders who trust scientists are attempting to adopt policies that combat climate change; other political leaders, however, debate scientists&#x02019; conclusions regarding climate change.</em></p>
<p>Because science is based on evidence and reasoning, science can be a good starting point for discovering a solution to a problem. A person can use the steps of the scientific method to gather information by observation or research, sort the information into categories, and look for relationships in the information. Once the information has been analyzed, a person can draw conclusions and support those conclusions with evidence. For example, consider a lamp that stops working. The question is why it doesn&#x02019;t work. The hypothesis is that the bulb has burnt out. A person can change the bulb and turn the lamp back on. If it lights, the bulb was the problem; if it does not, the hypothesis is not supported, and the person must go back and revise their hypothesis &#x02013; perhaps the lamp is not plugged in, the wiring is faulty, or it was accidentally unplugged. By using the steps of the scientific method, they can arrive at a solution based on evidence.</p>
<p>However, some topics cannot be studied by strict scientific methods. Science requires the ability to proven with empirical processes of observation and testing. It must be free from personal interpretation or opinion. Science cannot judge between right and wrong, or good and evil. It cannot judge the artistic quality of a work of art. These are topics that one might come up with a set of criteria for judging them, but are ultimately reliant on personal opinion. What one person might view as an unethical business practice, another person consider as good business sense. Science can provide statistics regarding the number of people negatively affected by the practice or the impact on the environment, but not the judgment deciding ethical or unethical. Likewise, some people like impressionist art, some like surrealism, some like realism. Art critics have a set of criteria for analyzing art, and some pieces obviously take more skill than others, but there is no accounting for taste.</p>
<h3><em>Pseudoscience vs. Science</em></h3>
<p>Some fields of study are related to science or carry with them some scientific concepts, but do not follow strict scientific processes to support their conclusions. These fields are categorized as pseudosciences because they do not have solid scientific knowledge or processes to prove that the phenomena actually exist. Paranormal investigations are a good example of pseudoscience. &#x0201C;Ghost hunters&#x0201D; might use scientific instruments to take measurements, make recordings, and carry out experiments. However, because paranormal investigators start with a conclusion &#x02013; that paranormal phenomena exist &#x02013; they approach their findings with bias and tend to accept only interpretations of the evidence that support their belief in the supernatural.</p>
<p>True scientific investigations and conclusions rely on verifiable evidence and proper scientific processes. When a theory is proposed, it is peer-reviewed by other scientists who verify the conclusions. The scientific community will come to a consensus on the validity of the scientist&#x02019;s argument and data supporting it. Some scientists may attempt to recreate the investigation to determine if they can reproduce the data. A valid theory is one that matches the evidence collected, can be reproduced to yield the same result, and can be used to predict results from future investigation. A good scientific theory may not be completely provable, but it can be verified.</p>
<h2 id="heading2"><em>Characteristics of a Scientist</em></h2>
<p>All scientists have some basic characteristics in common. A scientist must extremely knowledgeable in their field to understand the phenomena they are studying and to keep all the details clear in their mind. In some fields, they must have an ability to perform higher level mathematics. Scientists must be detail-oriented. Many phenomena result in subtle changes or rely on looking at large images to find a small detail. Scientists must be able to focus on those small details.</p>

<p class="caption" style="text-align:center;">Scientists can come from any gender, class, or ethnic group. While they share some characteristics, they are not all the same. Each brings unique talents to the study of science.</p>
</div>
<p>Scientists must be able to think abstractly in order to understand objects that are truly massive or incredibly tiny. Abstract thinking is needed to create models of these objects that can simulate the real thing. Science also requires the ability to reason deductively (going from general information to more specific details) and inductively (taking specific information and making generalizations). Scientists must be able to perform repeated tasks in the same way and yield the same results.</p>
<p>Scientists are often stereotyped as being more focused on numbers than creative ideas, but creativity is essential for scientific innovation. Creativity shows up in the design of the experiments and in the development of models to demonstrate the processes or structures. Scientists also demonstrate creativity when drawing conclusions from the data. Reasoning from a data set is rarely straight forward. Good scientists can make connections that most people would not be able to see.</p>
<p>When carrying out investigations, scientists must be able to keep an open-mind. They may have a hypothesis or a possible answer to their scientific question, but they cannot hold on to that hypothesis too strongly. Good scientists need to be able to set the hypothesis aside if the data does not support it. Data and observations drive the conclusions of good science, not the pre-conceived ideas of the researcher. Scientists must put aside opinions, beliefs, or pre-conceived solutions and draw conclusions based on the data.</p>
<p>Bias, or pre-conceived ideas, can cause a scientist to ignore data that doesn&#x02019;t fit the conclusion that they are hoping to see. It may cause the scientist to make measurements in a way that the data doesn&#x02019;t contradict their ideas. Scientists are sometimes pressured into proving a certain point. A corporation may not want to believe that their product is dangerous, or do not want evidence that it is. They may pressure scientists testing the product to come with a particular conclusion. For example, in the 1960s, evidence showed that eating sugar was directly linked to heart disease. Sugar corporations paid scientists from Harvard University to publish studies linking heart disease to saturated fat instead of sugar. The false study was very effective. Even today, many people still believe fat to be more dangerous for their health than sugar.</p>
<h2 id="summary"><em>Summary</em></h2>
<p>Scientific strategies can be applied to many problems. However, scientific concepts must be proven by observable or testable data. Science cannot answer questions about beliefs or opinions. Science is objective and based on evidence. Pseudosciences are fields of study that claim to use scientific ideas or that predate modern science. Often pseudosciences start with a faulty foundation or bias; paranormal investigators, for example, tend to only accept interpretations of evidence that confirm their belief in the supernatural. While scientists come from any ethnic group, gender, or culture, they all share some basic characteristics. Scientists must have extensive knowledge in their field, the ability to think creatively and abstractly, and the ability to reason deductively and inductively. Good scientists also keep an open mind, so that biases do not affect their conclusions.</p>
