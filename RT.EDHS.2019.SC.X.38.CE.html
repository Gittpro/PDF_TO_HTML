<p><strong>Nature of Science</strong></p>
<p>Science can help people to understand the natural world, to solve problems in society, and to create important technologies. Certain characteristics help scientists to perform good scientific processes. Science also has characteristics that define what questions that can be studied, how those questions can be answered, and how people can be confident in the conclusions from the study.</p>
<p>Characteristics of a Scientist</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Knowledge needed to understand complex systems</p></li>
<li><p>In many cases, ability to perform high-level math</p></li>
<li><p>Detail-oriented to analyze a large amount of data to find relationships</p></li>
<li><p>Detail-oriented to find a small amount of evidence in a large observation (think of analyzing images from telescopes and looking for particular stars)</p></li>
<li><p>Ability to reason abstractly in order to create and use models to understand large and complex systems, or systems that are too small to observe</p></li>
<li><p>Creative in the ability to design experiments, create models, and develop conclusions</p></li>
<li><p>Ability to perform deductive and inductive reasoning</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>deductive</strong> &#x02013; general information to specific details</p></li>
<li><p><strong>inductive</strong> &#x02013; specific details and generalize to the larger world</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Must be open-minded and willing to set aside their hypothesis if data doesn&#x02019;t support it</p></li>
<li><p>Scientists may come from every race, culture, nation, or gender.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Characteristics of Science</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Methodical process to study the natural or physical world</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Question is identified.</p></li>
<li><p>Data is collected and analyzed.</p></li>
<li><p>Conclusion is drawn supported by data.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Conclusions or theories are not proven, but can be verified.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Conclusion must fit data collected.</p></li>
<li><p>Study can be repeated and yield the same result.</p></li>
<li><p>Theory can be used to make predictions of future results.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Can only answer questions that are objective and not subject to opinion.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Cannot answer questions of right or wrong</p></li>
<li><p>Cannot determine if something is good or evil</p></li>
<li><p>Cannot judge something as beautiful or ugly</p></li>
</ul></li></ul>
<p>Pseudoscience</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Name literally means &#x0201C;false science&#x0201D;</p></li>
<li><p>Mimic science, but are based on faulty assumptions or poor scientific techniques</p></li>
<li><p>Includes fields such as alchemy, astrology, and phrenology</p></li>
</ul>
<p>One example of pseudoscience is astrology. Astrology is the belief that the movement of the planets through the constellations can affect a person&#x02019;s behavior or can be used to predict future events in a person&#x02019;s life or in the world. Constellations only have relevance when viewed from Earth. Stars are actually trillions and trillions of miles apart and have no influence on each other or the planets. There has never been any proof that correct predictions from astrology are anything other than coincidence. Because there is no way to measure any influence of the movement of the planets, there can never be any objective proof.</p>
<p><strong>Review Questions</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p>What is the danger to the scientific process if a scientist does not keep an open mind?</p>
<p><textarea style="width: 60%; height: 10em" maxlength="3000" id="Ex1"></textarea></p>
<p><button onclick="document.getElementById('Exercise3').style.visibility='visible'; return false;" class="revealButton" style="border-radius: 5px; background-color: #777777; color: white">Solution</button></p>
<div style="background-color: #EEE; border-radius: 5px; padding: 5px;" class="sampleAnswer">
<div style="visibility: hidden;" id="Exercise3">
<p>The scientist may remove data that does not fit the theory. They may design the experiment to get a particular result. They may misinterpret data because they wish to get a particular conclusion.</p>
</div></div></li>
<li><p>What kinds of questions can a scientist answer? What questions cannot be answered by science?</p>
<p><textarea style="width: 60%; height: 10em" maxlength="3000" id="Ex1"></textarea></p>
<p><button onclick="document.getElementById('Exercise4').style.visibility='visible'; return false;" class="revealButton" style="border-radius: 5px; background-color: #777777; color: white">Solution</button></p>
<div style="background-color: #EEE; border-radius: 5px; padding: 5px;" class="sampleAnswer">
<div style="visibility: hidden;" id="Exercise4">
<p>Scientific questions must have an objective answer. They must have a conclusion that can be supported by evidence. They cannot answer questions that are subject to a personal opinion or an emotional response.</p>
</div></div></li>
<li><p>What makes a field of study a pseudoscience and not a true scientific field?</p>
<p><textarea style="width: 60%; height: 10em" maxlength="3000" id="Ex1"></textarea></p>
<p><button onclick="document.getElementById('Exercise5').style.visibility='visible'; return false;" class="revealButton" style="border-radius: 5px; background-color: #777777; color: white">Solution</button></p>
<div style="background-color: #EEE; border-radius: 5px; padding: 5px;" class="sampleAnswer">
<div style="visibility: hidden;" id="Exercise5">
<p>A pseudoscience may mimic scientific investigation, but the studies are based on assumptions that cannot be verified scientifically. The conclusions drawn from these studies cannot be supported by data from an objective experiment.</p>
</div></div></li>
<li><p>Can you tell by looking at someone whether they would be a good scientist? Explain your answer.</p>
<p><textarea style="width: 60%; height: 10em" maxlength="3000" id="Ex1"></textarea></p>
<p><button onclick="document.getElementById('Exercise6').style.visibility='visible'; return false;" class="revealButton" style="border-radius: 5px; background-color: #777777; color: white">Solution</button></p>
<div style="background-color: #EEE; border-radius: 5px; padding: 5px;" class="sampleAnswer">
<div style="visibility: hidden;" id="Exercise6">
<p>No, the characteristics of a good scientist have no relation to the way someone looks. Even stereotypes, such as lab coats and glasses or a cluttered appearance, are not necessarily true. The characteristics of a scientist are based on knowledge and personality, such as creativity, inquisitiveness, and an open mind. Good scientists can come from any gender, ethnic group, or culture.</p>
