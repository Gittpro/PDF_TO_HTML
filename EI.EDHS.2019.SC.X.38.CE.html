<p>When you think of a scientist, what image comes to mind? What are some characteristics common among scientists? Write your answers in the following text box.</p>
<p><textarea style="width: 60%; height: 10em" maxlength="3000" id="Ex1"></textarea></p>
<p>You probably thought of the scientists in movies and on TV: people in white lab coats working in bright labs, creating, studying, and inventing new things. (Perhaps even, say, cloning a dinosaur or building a robot with artificial intelligence!) Usually these scientists are shown to be highly intelligent and very focused on their research. Movie scientists are also often extremely cluttered or bumbling about with poor social skills, as though their obsession with their work makes it impossible to do other human things. Many of these characteristics are stereotypes and are not typical of real-world scientists.</p>

<p>Scientists clearly need to be knowledgeable in their field of expertise. They also need to detail-oriented to identify the evidence that supports their theories. For example, consider the astronomer who discovered the existence of Pluto. Starting in 1929, American astronomer Clyde W. Tombaugh began to compare tiny dots on telescope images, ultimately concluding that the object on his charts was a new dwarf planet. It was such a small detail that only someone very focused could have seen it!</p>
<p>Scientists also need a high level of creativity. Scientists design experiments, whether inside or outside the laboratory; sometimes these experiments require a whole new way of approaching a problem. Scientists also develop models to study phenomena or to present their conclusions. They need to be creative and often think &#x0201C;outside of the box&#x0201D; when analyzing data. The conclusion may not be straight-forward. Scientists often can find relationships in the data that most people would not see.</p>
<p>Scientists also need to be open-minded. They cannot hold onto a theory when the data that they collect does not support it. Scientists need to be willing to put aside their opinions and analyze the data objectively. Only then can the conclusion be free of bias and be the best explanation based on the data. If a scientist&#x02019;s theory becomes more important than true scientific discovery, the scientist may ignore some of the measurements or adjust the numbers so that they fit the theory. The scientist may design the experiment in a way to get the conclusion that they are looking for. Many errors have happened in science when scientists began with a conclusion and made the data fit their conclusion.</p>
<p>While scientists typically need a particular set of personality traits, that doesn&#x02019;t mean that all scientists are the same. Good scientists come from any background, gender, or ethnic group. Famous scientists have been men and women, come from wealthy families or have grown up poor. They have come from every continent, and every ethnic group. In many cases, the unique background of a scientist may provide a different point of view that they can use to make a model, design an experiment, or draw a conclusion.</p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(153, 51, 0);"><strong>Characteristics of Science</strong></span></p>
<p>Science is a methodical process used to study the physical world. The scientific method is often described as having five to seven steps. Simplified, however, the steps often follow this basic sequence: a question is formulated, data is collected and analyzed, and a conclusion is drawn, supported by the data. This process can be used to analyze many different problems, but in some cases the conclusions are subjective (a matter of opinion) because science cannot come to a final conclusion.</p>

<p class="caption" style="text-align:center;">Leonardo da Vinci&#x02019;s painting of the Mona Lisa is one of the most studied works of art in history.</p>
</div>
<p>Do you like this painting? Do you consider it a work of art? Is that a scientific conclusion? Explain your answers in the following text box.</p>
<p><textarea style="width: 60%; height: 10em" maxlength="3000" id="Ex1"></textarea></p>
<p><button onclick="document.getElementById('Exercise1').style.visibility='visible'; return false;" class="revealButton" style="border-radius: 5px; background-color: #777777; color: white">Solution</button></p>
<div style="background-color: #EEE; border-radius: 5px; padding: 5px;" class="sampleAnswer">
<div style="visibility: hidden;" id="Exercise1">
<p>The first two questions are a matter of personal preference. They cannot be considered scientific because a person&#x02019;s opinion is a matter of personal taste. Some think that the Mona Lisa is a beautiful woman and the painting is masterful. Some think that she is really quite plain and the colors are kind of drab.</p>
</div></div>
<p>In the above image, da Vinci created a portrait of a young woman with a landscape in the background. Many people have spent years studying this work of art &#x02013; but is it good? Science cannot answer that question. Scientists can study the materials that da Vinci used, they can determine the combinations of pigments that he mixed to get the particular colors, and they can even determine how light is reflected off of certain portions to get desired effects. However, the artistic quality of the painting can ultimately come down to a matter of taste. There may be some science in creating a set of standards that can be used to judge a work of art, but &#x0201C;beauty is in the eye of the beholder.&#x0201D; One person may love the way the painting looks, while another might find it simple and boring.</p>
<p>Science deals with facts about natural phenomena and draws conclusions based on those facts. Science cannot answer questions of right or wrong, good or evil, beautiful or ugly. Subjects such as philosophy, ethics, and aesthetics try to come up with a set of standards that can be used to answer those questions. However, standards on subject topics can never be exact; many answers are unlikely to be a simple choice between one or the other. The true answer may lie somewhere in between.</p>
<p><strong>Pseudoscience</strong></p>
<p>In some fields, the boundary between science and philosophy were once not so clear. These are sometimes called pseudosciences and include subjects such as alchemy, astrology, and phrenology. While evidence that shows these ideas have little scientific merit, some people today still believe that conclusions drawn from these studies have a scientific basis. Science, however, has shown them to be completely false.</p>
<p>In some cases, these studies were carried out by scientists that were trying to understand nature. Alchemists of ancient times and the Middle Ages were trying to discover the nature of matter. However, some of their fundamental beliefs about nature were incorrect, making their study was flawed. Some of the first people to map the stars were astrologers, who believed that in understanding the movements of celestial objects, one could predict the future. Phrenologists believed that the size, shape, and particular bumps on the skull could predict a person&#x02019;s mental abilities and personality. Although this did lead to a study of anatomy, the beliefs were not founded in fact.</p>
<div style="width:349px; font-size: 80%;">
<img width="349" height="262" src="ei.edhs.2019.sc.x.38.ce/img3.jpg" alt="The image shows a human skull marked with phrenological labels."/>
<p class="caption" style="text-align:center;">Phrenology is a debunked pseudoscience that claims to predict mental traits based on the shape of the skull.</p>
</div>
<p>So why are these areas considered pseudoscience, while chemistry, astronomy, and anatomy are considered science? Those pseudoscience fields have theories or conclusions that did not stand up when new information was discovered. For example, astrology studied the movement of planets through constellations, particularly the twelve constellations of the zodiac. Astronomy discovered that those constellations were actually made of stars that were trillions and trillions of miles away from each other and Earth and only have any significance to each other when viewed from Earth. The claims of alchemy and phrenology, as well as other pseudoscience fields, also did not stand up to later scientific study.</p>
<p>What incorrect information formed the foundation of alchemy? What does modern science know about matter that is different from the alchemists? You may need to do a little research to answer the question. Write your answer in the following text box.</p>

<div style="visibility: hidden;" id="Exercise2">
<p>Alchemists believed that all matter could be divided into four elements: earth, fire, water, and air. They believed that different types of matter could be related to a combination of these four elements. Beginning in the mid-1600s, scientists discovered that matter is made of 90 naturally occurring elements that have no relation to the four classical elements.</p>
</div></div>
<p><span style="color: rgb(153, 51, 0);"><strong>The Science of Physics</strong></span></p>
<p>Physics is a science concerned with the interaction of matter and energy. Most of physics involves the movement (energy) of objects (matter). The energy can come in many forms, and matter can be as small as subatomic particles or as large as planets, stars, and galaxies. Scientists can study these subjects using scientific methods. They use the characteristics of a good scientist to study this aspect of the natural world. When using proper techniques, scientists can develop good conclusions or theories that explain the way the universe works.</p>
<p>A <strong>scientific theory</strong> is the best explanation of a scientific phenomenon or the best answer to a scientific question. Scientific theories are repeatedly tested against new information. Theories are strengthened when new information confirms the theory. In other cases, new information causes a theory or model to be changed. For example, the modern atomic theory was a compilation of centuries of scientific study. The model of the atom was refined throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The model that was developed can be used to explain the properties of elements and can be used to predict the properties of elements that have not been discovered.</p>
<p>Although science is constantly changing, theories provide a useful explanation and prediction of processes in nature. It&#x02019;s also important to remember that science is not just in the lab &#x02013; the natural world affects everyone, and many issues facing the world can be understood by science. Science can provide a clear understanding of natural processes for political leaders who make decisions. Scientists typically cannot make the decisions, but they can provide important information that leaders can use to make the best decisions possible, if those leaders are willing to listen.</p>
<p>Even when science is not used for making decisions in society, it is still useful in many other ways. Science helps to develop new products or to make existing products better. Scientists and engineers examine problems or needs in society and develop solutions to meet those needs. Smartphones, lasers used in medical procedures, and genetically modified foods are all products of scientific innovation.</p>
